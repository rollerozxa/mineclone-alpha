# affect mob spawners.
# This setting is only read at startup.
mobs_spawn (Spawn mobs naturally) bool true

# If enabled, only peaceful mobs will appear naturally. This does not
# affect mob spawners.
# This setting is only read at startup.

# If enabled, the “flat” map generator generates a Classic Superflat world:
# Completely flat, 1 layer of grass blocks on top of 2 layers of dirt on
# top of a final layer of bedrock. No caves, trees or plants.
# Also, if enabled, the setting “mgflat_flags” is ignored.
# If disabled, Minetest's default flat map generator is used, that is, trees,
# caves, and a deeper underground can be generated.
#
# Caution: Change this setting with care!
# If you change this setting, then play on an existing flat world
# that started with a different setting (e.g. you changed from superflat
# from “enabled” to “disabled”), there will be continuity errors when players
# reach new areas. Most importantly, the void is much higher in Superflat than
# in “normal” Flat.
# But creating new flat worlds after changing this setting should be safe.
mcl_superflat_classic (Classic superflat map generation) bool false

# If disabled, no ores will be generated.
mcl_generate_ores (Generate Ores) bool true

# Make some blocks emit decorative particles like flames. This setting
# specifies the detail level of particles, with higher levels being
# more CPU demanding.
# WARNING: This setting has quite poor performance and can slow down your
# game by a lot.
